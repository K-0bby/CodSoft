                    Socrates (c. 470 – 399 BC) was a Greek philosopher who is often regarded as the father of Western philosophy. Born in Athens, he spent his life questioning the world around him and engaging in dialogue with his fellow citizens to explore the nature of ethics, justice, and knowledge. Unlike other philosophers of his time, Socrates left no written records; instead, his thoughts and teachings were preserved through the works of his students, particularly Plato.
                    <br><br>
                    Socrates developed a method of inquiry known as the Socratic method, which involves asking probing questions to expose contradictions in one's thoughts and stimulate critical thinking. This approach laid the foundation for the dialectical method used in philosophy and education today.

                    Socrates was a controversial figure in Athens, known for challenging the status quo and questioning the moral integrity of the city's leaders. His unyielding commitment to truth and his belief that <cite><q>the unexamined life is not worth living</q></cite> led to his trial in 399 BC, where he was accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. Despite being given the opportunity to escape, Socrates chose to accept the death penalty, drinking poison hemlock as his final act of defiance against injustice.
                    <br><br>
                    Socrates' legacy endures through the philosophical traditions that followed him. His life and teachings have inspired countless thinkers throughout history, making him one of the most influential figures in the development of Western philosophy. His dedication to seeking truth and understanding continues to be a cornerstone of philosophical inquiry.
